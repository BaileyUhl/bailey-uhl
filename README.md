**Hi, I'm Bailey Uhl.**

I’m a front-end web developer and designer who loves building clean, responsive websites that look great and perform even better. Over the past few years, I’ve designed and developed WordPress and Shopify sites, created email campaigns, and used SEO and analytics to help optimize websites.

I like combining creativity with problem-solving, bringing ideas to life through design, code, and strategy. Whether it’s refining a layout, improving user experience, or tracking how people interact with a page, I enjoy finding simple ways to make the web work better.
